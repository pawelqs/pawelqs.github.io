[boards](https://github.com/pawelqs/boards) is my R package that I use to have an easy access to the data objects of many projects. **boards** is built on top of the [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) package, which allows easy reading, storing and versioning of data using board objects, and which I started using last year. 

The boards package keeps all project boards in one, central location, making it easy to search and read the data stored in any project board.

See the [boards README](https://github.com/pawelqs/boards#boards-) for the examples of how do I use the boards package.
