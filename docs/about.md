**Hi!**

I am Paweł Kuś and I am a PhD Candidate at Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland. I'm bioinformatician, data scientist, and big fan of all natural sciences. On this page I want to share some of my work with broader scientific community.

If you are interested in some of my work, feel free to contact me at [pawel.kus@polsl.pl](mailto:pawel.kus@polsl.pl)
