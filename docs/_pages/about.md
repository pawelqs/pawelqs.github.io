## Hi!

My name is Paweł Kuś. I'm **bioinformatician**, **computational biologist**, **researcher**, **and big fan of all natural sciences**. 

I have completed my Ph.D. at the [Silesian University of Technology](https://www.polsl.pl/en/) in Gliwice, Poland, in the field of Computer Science, doing research on the evolution of cancer. My doctoral dissertation was titled *Models of cancer genome evolution used to evaluate the role of selection and occurrence of new mutations*. Although I studied at the technical university, these few years of my doctoral research on cancer reawakened my great interest in biology and the life sciences.

I feel great working at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and biology/life sciences.

Check out my work experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pawe%C5%82-ku%C5%9B-695895152/), and my papers and software using the buttons below!
