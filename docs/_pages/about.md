**Hi!**

My name is Paweł Kuś. I'm **bioinformatician**, **computational biologist**, **researcher**, **and big fan of all natural sciences**. I have finished my PhD at the Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice, Poland. I'm bioinformatician, data scientist. On this page I want to share some of my work with broader scientific community.

If you are interested in some of my work, feel free to contact me at [pawel.s.kus@proton.me](mailto:pawel.s.kus@proton.me)
